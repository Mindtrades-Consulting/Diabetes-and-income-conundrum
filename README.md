# Diabetes-and-income-conundrum
This analysis aims to dispel some common myths in the understanding distribution of diabetes among the common populace. It takes a partly economic and partly demographic approach towards finding important geographical centers for diabetes in terms of the total count, factors such as racial profile and income status, and its impact on diabetes count by counties in the USA. 
# Objective
To analyze the relationship between different variables (income, racial profile by county) to diabetes in the USA and identify factors that most contribute to diabetes. Apart from that, developing a linear regression model that can be used as a forecasting tool for predicting diabetes count given the income, population profile as an input variable. For performing the analysis, we have considered the following datasets.

# Data Source 
1) Zip to county (FIPS) data (2019)
2) Countwise diabetes data (Diagnosed Diabetes; Total (Total); Adults Aged 20+ Years; Crude Number; U.S. Counties; 2017)
3) Gross income by zip code (2017)
4) County wise population data by race and total population (2017)

# Data Analysis
The data is initially processed using standard python-based techniques. We use the tried and tested panda library for this purpose. Once we have the final data set, we visualize the data on a map and later use a sklearn statistical library to construct linear regression models. We divide the data based on different parameters including population, income by county, diabetes count by counties, and diabetes per 1000.

# Sumamry
Two_or_more_races_population play a vital role in diabetes count followed by Asian population count
Gross income by county does not have much predictive power towards finding diabetes count
